        <h2>
            Port of Djupvik
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close to the beautiful smaller island
            Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the port is a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes
            to life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz. Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is 
            Djupvik Hotel, with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant. Both the port and the fishing 
            village have a beautiful view of two popular bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.
        </p>

        <p>
            The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly beautiful and invites to nice scenery
            and views on foot, by bike or by car. North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is 
            well soothed for a nice swim. The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles and it 
            is about twice as long to Stora Karlsö (4nm).
